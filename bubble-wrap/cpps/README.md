Circle packing projective structures
====================================

Represent triangulated surfaces with a doubly-connected edge list,
find circle packing projective structures with a given triangulation
as a dual graph, and compute invariants of these (holonomy, etc.).


TODO: high priority
-------------------

* Improve the general path lifter
* Refactor into a library (dcel, vertex equations, solver, etc) + programs (KAT finder, lifter, etc.)

TODO: low priority
-------------------

* Compute nice embedding of triangulations in R^3
* Add support for crosscaps
* Handle boundary conditions with special faces instead of missing
  twins
* Make it easier to glue in a "hex-natural" way
